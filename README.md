Hello, I'm Arleen, a computer science student at the University of Toronto; here's a little about me:
- I have coded robots in embedded C -> One of my major projects was a carwash for Obotz - Think out of the Book Competition, where I won first runner-up.
- I’m currently learning two coding languages: C# and Python
- I currently have a part-time job and am volunteering at STEAM-related summer camps to inspire youth and foster their curiosity in STEAM.
- I participated in the QSEA Program and learned C++
- I participated in the UofT Machine Learning and AI in Python Circuit Stream Program
- Outside of coding, I have been a part of DECA and qualified for ICDC (2025)
