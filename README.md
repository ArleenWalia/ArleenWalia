Hello, I'm Arleen, currently an AP student; here's a little about me:
- I have a solid aspiration to pursue CS/CE, and although I'm just a beginner coder (as of 2023), that will not stop me.
- I have coded robots in embedded C -> One of my major projects was a carwash for Obotz - Think out of the Book Competition where I won first runner-up.
- I’m currently learning two coding languages: C# and Python
- I’m looking to create cool side projects that will aid my abilities and help me pursue a career in CS/CE.
- I currently have a part-time job and am volunteering at STEAM-related summer camps to inspire youth and foster their curiosity in STEAM.
- I participated in the QSEA Program and learned C++
